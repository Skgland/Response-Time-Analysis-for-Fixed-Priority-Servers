=====================================================================

This Project is an implementation of the paper [Response Time Analysis for Fixed Priority Servers][1] by Hamann et al.
written in [Rust].

The goal behind this project is a better understanding of said paper as preparation for writing a seminar paper.

The implementation tries to reference the paper where practical and improve on it with type safety.
The examples in the paper are incorporated as tests where possible.
